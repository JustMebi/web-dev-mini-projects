Web Dev Mini Projects

This is a growing collection of small front-end projects I've built to practice and demonstrate concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📁 Project List

1. Dark Mode Toggle – Simple button to toggle site theme
2. Calculator – Basic calculator with JavaScript logic
3. Responsive Pricing Table – Built with Flexbox
4. Random Quote Generator – Fetches quotes using API

Each project is self-contained in its own folder. Feel free to explore and clone.
